# BOIDI
This is a project to construct BOIDI; Blockchain-based Open ID Infrastructure.
# FAVOR
I have almost no knowledge about programming or infrastructure building, and also am a busy student, so I think I won't be able to continue or improve this project.
If you have interested in this project, you can use this idea as your idea.
However, I put SHA-256 hash as my identification in the paper, so be careful of treating this.
There may be no way to realize this project, but someday, I beleave, we can make it true.
So I think we need to improve and brush up this idea to be prepared for a better world.
Please help this project.


God bress the world, beyond 2020, beyond singularity, and forever
